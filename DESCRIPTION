Description: oneClass implements the one-class classifiers one-class SVM,
    biased SVM, and Maxent, as custom functions for the train function
    of the package caret.
    Thus, the extensive infrastructure of the caret package can be used
    for training and analyzing one-class classification models.
    The infrastructure is further extended by one-class classification
    specific tools which should help the which are useful to
    understand and thus improve one-class classifier outcomes in the
    absence of a representative and complete test data.
    The package is developed for one-class land cover classification and
    also handles raster data.
